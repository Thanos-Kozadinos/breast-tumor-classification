# breast-tumor-classification

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the breast tissue. It is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the second-most common cancer overall. Early detection and treatment of breast cancer are crucial for improving the chances of successful outcomes. One of the most effective ways to detect breast cancer is through medical imaging techniques, such as mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in assisting medical professionals with the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer from medical images. This Github repository aims to showcase the development and implementation of machine learning models for the classification of breast cancer images.

The data used for this project come from the paper "Spanhol, F.A., Oliveira, L.S., Petitjean, C. and Heutte, L., 2015. A dataset for breast cancer histopathological image classification. Ieee transactions on biomedical engineering, 63(7), pp.1455-1462.".

For the project various techniques will be used and also various tools as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
